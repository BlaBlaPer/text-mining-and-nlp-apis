## RxNLP Text Mining and NLP APIs

RxNLP's Text Mining and NLP APIs provide access to some basic and advanced text analytics functionality over the cloud. The APIs are meant for both commercial and research use. We have recently been getting a lot of interest from University users. The APIs are tracked via Mashape, so you will have to register for a [Mashape account](http://www.mashape.com) and then subscribe to the [API plan](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/pricing) that works for you. For limited or trial use, you should select the 'basic' plan with free per day requests. Here is a list of the current APIs:

1. [HTML2Text](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp#1-html2text) - Extract only the body text of any HTML page or extract the body text directly from a URL.

2. [N-Gram and Word Counting](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#3-ngramcounter) - Generate and count words and n-grams in any language. This endpoint generates n-grams and frequency counts of the n-grams based on the provided text. The n-grams and its frequency are returned in descending order of frequency. 

3. [Text Similarity](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#2-textsimilarity) - Compute similarity between two pieces of texts (long or short) using well known measures such as Jaccard, Dice and Cosine.
