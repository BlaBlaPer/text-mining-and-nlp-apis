# Text Mining and NLP APIs

RxNLP's Text Mining and NLP APIs provide access to some basic and advanced text analytics functionality over the cloud. The APIs are meant for both commercial as well as research use. We currently have a mix of academic and industry users. To use RxNLP's APIs and the wrappers for the APIs, you will have to register for a <b>[Mashape account](http://www.mashape.com)</b> and then subscribe to the [API plan](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/pricing) that works for you. For limited or trial use, you should select the 'basic' plan with free per day requests. The <b>X-Mashape-Key</b> key that you see on mashape will be your API Key. Below you will find a list of our current APIs and links to documentation.

##HTML2Text

The [HTML2Text](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp#1-html2text) endpoint extracts only the body text of any HTML page or extracts the body text directly from a URL.

##N-Gram and Word Counting

The [N-Gram and Word Counting](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#3-ngramcounter) endpoint generates word and n-gram counts in any language. The words or n-grams and its frequency are returned in descending order of frequency.

##Text Similarity 
The [Text Similarity](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#2-textsimilarity) endpoint computes similarity between two pieces of texts (long or short) using well known measures such as Jaccard, Dice and Cosine.

##Sentence Clustering 

The [Sentence Clustering](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#cluster-chunk-of-text) endpoint clusters texts such as Tweets, Customer Support Tickets, News Articles, Surveys, User Reviews and others into logical sentence groups. You get the clusters, cluster score and cluster labels.
