The APIs are meant for both commercial as well as research use. We currently have a mix of academic and industry users. To use RxNLP's APIs and the wrappers for the APIs, you will have to register for a <b>[Mashape account](http://www.mashape.com)</b> and then subscribe to the [API plan](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/pricing) that works for you. For limited or trial use, you should select the 'basic' plan with free per day requests. The <b>X-Mashape-Key</b> key that you see on mashape will be your API Key. Below you will find a list of our current APIs and links to documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Table of Contents\r\n- [HTML2Text API](#html2text)\r\n- [Text Similarity API](#text-similarity)\r\n- [Sentence Clustering API](#sentence-clustering)\r\n- [N-Gram and Word Counting API](#n-gram-and-word-counting)\r\n- [Finding your X-Mashape Key](#finding-the-x-mashape-key)\r\n\r\n\r\n##HTML2Text\r\n\r\nThe [HTML2Text](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp#1-html2text) endpoint extracts only the body text of any HTML page or extracts the body text directly from a URL.\r\n\r\n- [ [Test on Mashape] (https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/) ]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n##N-Gram and Word Counting\r\n\r\nThe [N-Gram and Word Counting](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#3-ngramcounter) endpoint generates word and n-gram counts in any language. The words or n-grams and its frequency are returned in descending order of frequency. \r\n\r\n- [ [N-Gram Counter API Documentation](http://www.rxnlp.com/api-reference/n-gram-and-word-counter-api-reference/) ]\r\n- [ [Test on Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/) ]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n##Text Similarity \r\nThe [Text Similarity](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#2-textsimilarity) endpoint computes similarity between two pieces of texts (long or short) using well known measures such as Jaccard, Dice and Cosine. \r\n\r\n- [ [Text Similarity API Documentation](http://www.rxnlp.com/api-reference/text-similarity-api-reference/) ]\r\n- [ [Simple Java Wrapper for Text Similarity](https://github.com/RxNLP/text-mining-and-nlp/tree/master/java) ]\r\n- [ [Test on Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/) ]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n##Sentence Clustering \r\n\r\nThe [Sentence Clustering](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/#cluster-chunk-of-text) endpoint clusters texts such as Tweets, Customer Support Tickets, News Articles, Surveys, User Reviews and others into logical sentence groups. You get the clusters, cluster score and cluster labels. \r\n\r\n- [ [Sentence Clustering API Documentation](http://www.rxnlp.com/api-reference/cluster-sentences-api-reference/) ]\r\n- [ [Test on Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/rxnlp/text-mining-and-nlp/) ]\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n#Finding the X-Mashape Key\r\n\r\n![Where to find your X-Mashape-Key](http://www.rxnlp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/X-Mashape-Key.png \"Where to find your X-Mashape-Key\")\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-21416130-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
